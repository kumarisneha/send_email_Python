Send an email with Python
=========================

Here are a few examples of how to use the email package to read, write, and send simple email messages, as well as more complex MIME messages.

.. note:: Donâ€™t forget to allow `less secure apps`_ on your Gmail account.

1. To send a basic email (without subject line), with a Gmail address, the code is in `maill.py  <https://github.com/kumarisneha/send_email_Python/blob/master/maill.py>`_
2. To send a clean email, with a sender, a receiver and a subject line, the code is in `elaborate_mail.py <https://github.com/kumarisneha/send_email_Python/blob/master/elaborate_mail.py>`_ .
3. To send a mail with attached file like text file, pdf files, images, audio files, the code is in the `mail_attachment.py <https://github.com/kumarisneha/send_email_Python/blob/master/mail_attachment.py>`_ .
4. To create and send a simple text message, the code is in the `read_write_mail.py <https://github.com/kumarisneha/send_email_Python/blob/master/read_write_mail.py>`_ .

Running the code:
*****************
Now open a terminal at the project root and run this command.
::

    $ python maill.py
    $ python elaborate_mail.py
    $ python mail_attachment.py
    $ python read_write_mail.py
